# futulingo

The materials (text and audio) for the Futurice open source language course materials, created as a company community outreach program initiative (http://www.spiceprogram.org). 

The word and phrase set is based on the Refugee Phrasebook (http://www.refugeephrasebook.de/). The vocabulary has been extended a bit.

The audio has been recorded at Futurice premises in Helsinki and in Tampere. In Helsinki the recording was done in the FutuCafé using Audio-Technica AT2020USB mic and Ableton Live 9 software. Audio editing was done in Audacity and Adobe Audition.

The materials have been used to create this online course: http://www.memrise.com/course/858328/

See LICENSE.md for the licensing detail (spoiler: it's permissive). 

This project is currently coordinated by ttur @ futurice.com.

## Structure

The word/phrase mappings MSA-Finnish-English are available at the project root in XLSX and ODT formats.

The "audio" directory contains sub-directories for each word/phrase category.

The sub-directories (such as "greetings") then contains all the recorded audio for that category.

Each audio file is named based on the word/phrase in english, and suffixed by an incremental id.
