# futulingo

The materials (text and audio) for the Futurice open source language course materials, created as a company community outreach program initiative (http://www.spiceprogram.org). 

The word and phrase set is based on the Refugee Phrasebook (http://www.refugeephrasebook.de/). The vocabulary has been extended a bit.

The audio has been recorded at Futurice premises.

See LICENSE.md for the licensing detail (spoiler: it's permissive). 

This project is currently coordinated by ttur @ futurice.com.

## Structure

The "audio" directory contains sub-directories for each word/phrase category.

The sub-directories (such as "greetings") contains all the recorded audio for that category.

Each audio file is named based on the word/phrase in english, and suffixed by an incremental id. 

The actual vocabulary mapping is still missing from this project. This is intentional, it will be added soon when the project goes public. It is currently being reviewed outside GitHub.
